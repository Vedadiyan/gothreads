# GOTHREADS 
gothreads is a library that allows you to create OS threads. It relies on C to create OS threads and allows you to cancel them when required. 

## Purpose 
If you need classical threads or you don't like go routines for any reason, you can use this library. 

## DISCLAIMER
C threads are heavy weight and they are scheduled by the OS while go routines are lightweight threads that are schedule by the go runtime.
